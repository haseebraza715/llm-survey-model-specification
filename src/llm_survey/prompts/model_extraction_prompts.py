Given the following qualitative survey excerpt, extract:

2. Causal or conditional relationships between variables
3. Hypotheses (if evident in the text)
4. Any moderating or mediating factors mentioned

Format your response as YAML with the following structure (do not use markdown code blocks or backticks):

Variables:
  - VariableName: Brief description of what this variable represents
  - AnotherVariable: Description...

Relationships:
  - If [condition], then [outcome]

  - When [context], [relationship] occurs

Hypotheses:
  - Hypothesis1: Description of the proposed relationship
  - Hypothesis2: Another proposed relationship

Moderators:
  - ModeratorVariable: How it affects the relationship

Context:

Excerpt:

Please be precise and only extract what is explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the text.

IMPORTANT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Variables should be specific and measurable concepts
2. Relationships must specify direction (positive/negative) and mechanism
3. Hypotheses should be testable and specific
