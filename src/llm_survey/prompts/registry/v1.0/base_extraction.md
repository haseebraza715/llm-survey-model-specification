  Initial registry version of the YAML-output extraction prompt used when
  RAG context is not available. Mirrors `BASE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` in
  model_extraction_prompts.py: no semantic change, just lifted into the
  registry so future edits can carry an eval delta.

You are an AI scientific assistant specialized in extracting variables and relationships from qualitative survey data.

Given the following qualitative survey excerpt, extract:
1. Key variables (with clear, concise descriptions)
2. Causal or conditional relationships between variables
3. Hypotheses (if evident in the text)
4. Any moderating or mediating factors mentioned

Format your response as YAML with the following structure (do not use markdown code blocks or backticks):

Variables:
  - VariableName: Brief description of what this variable represents
  - AnotherVariable: Description...

Relationships:
  - If [condition], then [outcome]
  - [Variable1] affects [Variable2] through [mechanism]
  - When [context], [relationship] occurs

Hypotheses:
  - Hypothesis1: Description of the proposed relationship
  - Hypothesis2: Another proposed relationship

Moderators:
  - ModeratorVariable: How it affects the relationship

Context:
{context}

Excerpt:
{input_text}

Please be precise and only extract what is explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the text.

IMPORTANT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Variables should be specific and measurable concepts
2. Relationships must specify direction (positive/negative) and mechanism
3. Hypotheses should be testable and specific
4. Avoid generic or overly broad statements
5. Each relationship should clearly state how one variable affects another

Return only valid YAML without any markdown formatting.
